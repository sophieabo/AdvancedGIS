# Custom Google Map for BikePgh

In this assignment, I created a custom Google-Map for a local non-profit BikePgh.  I took a screenshot of a representative image on the BikePgh website and uploaded it to Adobe Color to pull out important colors. I started the customization by selecting the “Retro” base theme, since it was similar to the feel of the BikePgh website. I then changed the colors of the land/water, infrastructure, and labels to align with the colors and overall style exhibited on the BikePgh website. See the website screenshot, colors, and the corresponding hex codes below.
