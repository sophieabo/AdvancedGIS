In this exercise, I used ArcGIS Insights to analyze the United States Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) pain pill database that “tracks the path of every single pain pill sold in the United States - by manufacturers and distributors to pharmacies in every town and city.” Specifically, I explored the flow of pain pills in and out of Mingo County, WV, a county with a substantially high rate of pills per person per year.
