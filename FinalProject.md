#  Exploring Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Database

For my final project, I explored Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in the United States. 

I created an easy-to-use, web-based dashboard that explores the distribution of current electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in the United States. I began by exploring and cleaning the USDOT’s publicly available Alternative Fueling Stations dataset based on null and invalid values, as well as removing superfluous fields. I then created a series of graphics that visualized trends within the Alternative Fueling Stations’ dataset, as well as complementary demographic information. 

The intended end-users of the dashboard are USDOT EV policy analysts and state-level officials. The users can explore the interactive dashboard to inform future EV charging station deployment, as well as identify areas for improved data collection, standardization, and further analysis. The dashboard can also easily be modified for public distribution and engagement.

This project explored the following questions: 
- How many EV charging stations are there in the United States and in each state?
- Where are EV charging stations located (parking lots, hotels, gas stations etc.)? 
- What is the geographic coverage of the EV charging stations based on a typical battery?
- What is the distribution of when the EV charging stations were built? 
- How many people live within a 5 minute drive of an EV charging station?
- What are the socioeconomic demographics of people within a 5 minute drive of an EV charging station?
- What is the distribution of EV charging station ownership (public or private)? 
- How many charging stations are there per number of electric vehicles in each state?
